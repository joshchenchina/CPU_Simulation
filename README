Project: CPU Simulation

Introduction:
In this project, the goal is to create a simulator for the simple CPU and associated main memory. This program is capable of reading a Register Transfer Notation (RTN) file, and specify how the instructions of ISA are implemented according to the RTN file. The program will demonstrate the functionality by a graphic user interface (GUI) and a set of unit-tests.

For this project, there is seventeen classes in my design, which are: Main.java, CPUsimulator.java, DataPath.java, ControlUnit.java, RTNController.java, RegisterFiles.java, MainMemory.java, Configuration.java, ProgramCounter.java, InstructionRegisters.java, StackPointer.java, MemoryAddress.java, MemoryData.java, A.java, C.java, ALU.java and GeneralRegister.java. 

There are two Gui: Gui_FrontPage.java and Gui_SimulationPage.java

There is also a unit test class: UnitTest.java.

To run the program in Command:
1. Go to the directory of this program in terminal
2. $ javac Main.java
3. $ java Main

In order to run the Gui
1. Go to the directory of this program in terminal
2. $ javac Gui_FrontPage.java
3. $ java Gui_FrontPage

In order to run the unit test
1. Go to the directory of this program in terminal
2. $ javac UnitTest.java
3. $ java UnitTest

Running Unit Test may not be successful using commands because of the version of Junit.
However, you can still run unit test or the whole program in BlueJ as following:
	Open BlueJ 
	Select ‘Project’
	Select ‘Open Non-BlueJ Project’ 
	Select this program directory.
Now you can run this program in BlueJ!
